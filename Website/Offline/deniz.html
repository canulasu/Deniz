<h3>What is DenizProject?</h3>

<p>
    DenizProject is a project aimed to create a fully free and open-source operating system.
    The project is mainly aimed at Unix/Linux based systems but aims to be compatinle with
    other operating systems as well. The project is currently in it's alpha development
    stages. The project currently includes a large collection of software, from Python
    and Ruby Scripts to fully compiled MacOS applications. At DenizProject, we believe
    that non open-source and proprietary software does not respect it's user's freedom
    and rights. Currently, the whole of the Deniz Operating System is released under
    the MIT liscense.
