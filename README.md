# The Deniz Operating System

The Deniz Operating Systems is a filesystem/operating system that can be installed as a fully fledged operating system or a filesystem aimed for unix based operating systems, but aims to be compatible with all operating systems that are advanced enough to run programs such as Python or Ruby, preferably both. The system also aims to be compatible with TUI or CLI systems. Currently, the repository contains all the apps and files of the file system.

*Why is Deniz Free?* Deniz is free because the whole point of the Deniz operating system is to be a free and open source project.
